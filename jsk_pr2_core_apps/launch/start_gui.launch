  jsk_android_gui: tap, pinch and sweep and use multi fingers to manipulate the Robots.
  Avaiable on Google Play.

<Setup>

On api-9 ros-android applications, app_manager and appmaster are needed.
You can launch them by "roslaunch local_app_manager app_manager.launch".
Currently we include this launches on robot.launch(/etc/ros/fuerte/robot.launch), so all the app_manager will be launched on ROBOT START.

When you start jsk_android_gui(this application) from the application "App Chooser", jsk_android_gui/start_gui.launch will be launched on the background. Thie launch file sets camera,points,spots,tasks parameter for auto-creating the buttons of GUI.

<Images>

The Default Subscribing topic is /tablet/marked/image_rect_color/compressed_throttle as sensor_msgs/CompressedImage.
We use mux to switch cameras and 3D sensors and  use image_view2 to illustrate.

 - jsk_android_gui/cameras_and_points_mux.launch is generated from cameras.yaml and points.yaml. If you changed sensors of ROBOT, you should add or delete the image topic (on cameras.yaml) or the pointcloud topic (on points.yaml).

 - RULE of cameras.yaml: please put a new camera's name to CameraList, and add new lines for the new camera: (new camera name): [(new topic name of image), (new topic name of camera_info)], and run create_mux_launch.py to re-generate cameras_and_points_mux.launch.

All the launch files are included in jsk_pr2_startup/jsk_pr2_sensors/tablet_startup.launch(see jsk_pr2_startup/pr2.launch:launch_tablet)
 - For using kinect, you also need to extra launch kinect_head.launch.(see jsk_pr2_startup/pr2.launch:launch_openni)
 - For using Show3DScreenPoint, you also need to extra launch pointcloud_screenpoint.launch.(see jsk_pr2_startup/pr2.launch:launch_jsk_pcl)
 - For using tweet, you also need to extra launch db_client.launch.(see jsk_pr2_startup/pr2.launch:launch_db)

 - (MoveCameraCenter mode) Send "/Tablet/Command" as jsk_smart_gui/Tablet, move ROBOT to look at the point you touched, see jsk_smart_gui/src/tablet_callback.l:MoveCameraCenterExecute().

touches(4 fingers)
 - (swiping up) Send "/Tablet/Command" as jsk_smart_gui/Tablet, TorsoUp.
 - (swiping down) Send "/Tablet/Command" as jsk_smart_gui/Tablet, TorsoDown.
 - (the others) Send "/Tablet/Command" as jsk_smart_gui/Tablet, TorsoStop.

touches(5 fingers)
 - (at least one finger moves more than 30 dots) Send "/Tablet/Command" as jsk_smart_gui/Tablet, TuckArmPose.

swipe(1 finger)
 - (MoveNeck mode) Send "/Tablet/Command" as jsk_smart_gui/Tablet, for moving the head(neck) of ROBOT, you have to swipe more than 30dots.

long touch(1 finger)
 - PushOnce: Send "/Tablet/Command" as jsk_smart_gui/Tablet.
 - PickOnce: Send "/Tablet/Command" as jsk_smart_gui/Tablet.
 - PlaceOnce: Send "/Tablet/Command" as jsk_smart_gui/Tablet.
 - GetTemplate: Send "/Tablet/Command" as jsk_smart_gui/Tablet.

Joy
 - (joystick view) BaseController, send "android/cmd_vel" as geometry_msgs/Twist, will be changed to "input_vel", see tablet_callback.l:SwithJoyExecute()

buttons
 - (radio buttons) use :rarm or :larm.
