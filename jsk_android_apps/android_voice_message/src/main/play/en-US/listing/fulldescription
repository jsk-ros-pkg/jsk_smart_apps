Android app for publishing speech-to-text results as ROS topic.

You have to configure Speech-To-Text from Setting > Language & Input > Google Voice Typing

You can subscribe the recognized voice text as:

 rostopic echo /Tablet/voice

and for Multi-byte users (like Japanese), you have to decode the text to UTF character. This is some example to show as Kanji/Hiragana

 rostopic echo --filter "print('transcript: [%s]\n---'%(', '.join(map(lambda x: '\'%s\''%(x.decode('utf-8')), m.transcript))))" /Tablet/voice
